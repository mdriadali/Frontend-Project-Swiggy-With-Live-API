## ⚠️ Note
This project uses Swiggy's live API.  
Since the API is not officially public, it might:
- Block requests due to CORS restrictions 🛑  
- Stop working temporarily if Swiggy updates their endpoints 🔄  
- Load slowly depending on the region 🌐  

If the app doesn’t load data:
1. Try using a CORS proxy (for example, https://cors-anywhere.herokuapp.com/).  
2. Or check the browser console for API request errors.
